3D Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built with Three.js.
It displays the Sun and eight planets orbiting with realistic speeds and interactive controls.

Features

Realistic orbital motion for each planet relative to real astronomical data
Sun emits light and has a glowing effect
Pause and resume the simulation
Adjust individual planet speeds with sliders
Control a global speed multiplier
Toggle between dark and light mode with adaptive colors
Floating labels for each planet
Clickable planet info panel showing name, distance from Sun, and orbital period
Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
